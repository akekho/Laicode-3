/* Sort With 2 Stacks
Description
Given an array that is initially stored in one stack, sort it with one additional stacks (total 2 stacks).
After sorting the original stack should contain the sorted integers and from top to bottom the integers are sorted in ascending order.

Assumptions:
The given stack is not null.

Requirements:
No additional memory, time complexity = O(n ^ 2).
